## Neubrutalism 🏗
Neubrutalism is UGLY on puropse. Brutalism is a 1950 architectural trend, which abandoning all decorations and creating brutally simple buildings made from concrete.  The digital style trend is defined by exposed grids, strong typography, layering, limited color palettes, and an almost unstyled HTML look. Turn of the century-inspired web graphics with bare HTML or a glitchy, grunge feel. In fact, it is very “anti-design.”
